# Spotify_code
Python code used to get needed data for Spotify dashboard

These files represent the Python code that I created to:

1.  Access the Spotify API and update the history json files: spotify API access file update publish.py

2.  Create an excel file with all the genres associated with individual songs: spotify json to to dataframe to excel genre publish.py

3.  Update the json files with user names: spotifyjsonupdate works publish.py
